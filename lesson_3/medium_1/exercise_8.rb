# Method calls can take expressions as arguments. Suppose we define a method called rps as follows, which follows the classic rules of rock-paper-scissors game: it returns the winning fist or, in the case of a tie, the fist that both players played.

def rps(fist1, fist2)
  if fist1 == "rock"
    (fist2 == "paper") ? "paper" : "rock"
  elsif fist1 == "paper"
    (fist2 == "scissors") ? "scissors" : "paper"
  else
    (fist2 == "rock") ? "rock" : "scissors"
  end
end

# What is the result of the following call?

puts rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock")

# The output will be "paper".

# When evaluating nested method calls, start from the innermost calls and work your way outward.
# So, you'd evaluate from left to right, but starting with the deepest nested calls first.
