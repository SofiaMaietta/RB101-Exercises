# Ben was tasked to write a simple ruby method to determine if an input string is an IP address representing dot-separated numbers. e.g. "10.4.5.11". He is not familiar with regular expressions. Alyssa supplied Ben with a method called is_an_ip_number? that determines if a string is a numeric string between 0 and 255 as required for IP numbers and asked Ben to use it.

# Alyssa reviewed Ben's code and says "It's a good start, but you missed a few things. You're not returning a false condition, and you're not handling the case that there are more or fewer than 4 components to the IP address (e.g. "4.5.5" or          "1.2.3.4.5" should be invalid)." Help Ben fix his code.

# def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
#   dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
#   while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
#     word = dot_separated_words.pop
#     break unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
#   end
#   return true
# end

def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  return false unless dot_separated_words.size == 4

  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    return false unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
  end

  true
end

# LS Solution:

# 1) To determine if there are exactly 4 dot-separated "words" in the string, you can simply add a check for dot_separated_words.size after splitting the string.

# 2) The other error in Ben's code is that instead of returning false upon encountering a non-numeric component, he used break to break out of the while loop. Once he breaks, control falls through to the return true statement. He can fix this by performing return false instead of break.

# 3) Ben's original return true on the last line of the method can be shortened to just true. This is because Ruby returns the result of the last evaluated expression.
